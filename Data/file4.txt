  "DER TAG"
  OR
  THE TRAGIC MAN

  _A bare chamber lighted by a penny dip which casts shadows. On a hard
  chair by a table sits an EMPEROR in thought. To him come his
  CHANCELLOR and an OFFICER._


CHANCELLOR. Your Imperial Majesty----

OFFICER. Sire----

EMPEROR (_the EMPEROR rises_). Is that the paper?

  (_Indicating a paper in the CHANCELLOR'S hand._)

CHANCELLOR (_presenting it_). It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's
  signature.

OFFICER. When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be
  at war with France and Russia.

EMPEROR. At last, this little paper----

CHANCELLOR. Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal
  signature. The----

EMPEROR. Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will
  not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown
  since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's
  Germany, when I have signed! And yet----

OFFICER. Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?

EMPEROR (_flashing_). Afraid!

OFFICER (_abject_). Oh, Sire!

EMPEROR. I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me
  every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand
  nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my
  teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."

OFFICER. That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have
  made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his
  deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword
  must speak.

EMPEROR (_approvingly_). There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one
  said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal
  go to them instead of to you." One at a time. (_To CHANCELLOR_) Why am
  I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's
  friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.

CHANCELLOR. For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire,
  your signature!

EMPEROR. What of Britain?

OFFICER (_intently_). This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk,
  draws near!

EMPEROR. The Day! To The Day! (_All salute The Day with their swords._)
  But when?

OFFICER. Now, if she wants it!

EMPEROR. There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued.
  Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain.

CHANCELLOR (_suavely_). Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in
  just now.

EMPEROR. If I was sure of that!

CHANCELLOR. I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her
  at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to
  turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with
  the civic powers.

EMPEROR. These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It
  is a land that in the past has done things.

OFFICER. In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies
  Britain's greatness.

EMPEROR. Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and
  sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her
  such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her,
  but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is
  her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed
  again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her
  epitaph.

CHANCELLOR. How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small
  excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags."
  That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret
  compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do
  not at present need we will not at present take.

EMPEROR. A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an
  infamous proposal.

CHANCELLOR. The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know
  them, Sire. Your signature?

EMPEROR (_gleaming_). I can fling a million men within the week across
  the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.

OFFICER (_with a frown_). There are a hundred gates to open that way.

EMPEROR. My guns shall open them.

OFFICER (_with meaning_). You can think of no easier road, Sire?

EMPEROR. I think of it night and day.

OFFICER. One further north--through Belgium?

EMPEROR. If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.

OFFICER (_misunderstanding_). On the contrary, Sire----

EMPEROR. Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor,
  by my plighted word.

OFFICER. Yet, Sire----

EMPEROR (_after hesitating_). No, no! I will not so stain my name.

CHANCELLOR. I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with
  France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.

EMPEROR. You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.

CHANCELLOR. Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have
  private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage
  France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.

EMPEROR. I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.

CHANCELLOR. She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such
  dastard words.

EMPEROR. Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.

CHANCELLOR. France will hack her way through her.

EMPEROR. My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.

CHANCELLOR. I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.

OFFICER. Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to
  sign?

CHANCELLOR. Bonaparte would have acted quickly.

EMPEROR. Bonaparte!

CHANCELLOR. The paper, Sire.

EMPEROR. Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it
  signed.

OFFICER (_warningly_). The least delay----

CHANCELLOR. Overmuch reflection----

EMPEROR. I wish to be alone.

  (_They retire respectfully, but anxious. He is left alone in
    thought._)

EMPEROR. Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only
  at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany,
  but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte,
  coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four,
  to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with
  Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we
  reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we
  embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into
  our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the
  plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London
  itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_
  I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there
  shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my
  colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel
  it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the
  world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come
  at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all!
  God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! (_Raising his brows
  threateningly_) _And there are still the Zeppelins!_ I'll sign!

  (_He sits in thought. He is very tired, and soon he is asleep. The
    lighting becomes strange; he dreams, and we see his dream. The
    SPIRIT OF CULTURE appears, a noble female figure in white robes._)

EMPEROR. Who's that?

CULTURE. A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed
  over happy Germany.

EMPEROR (_who gives her royal honor_). A friend--a consort! I would hear
  you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.

CULTURE. You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you
  were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at
  times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one,
  but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.

EMPEROR. It was all done for you.

CULTURE. So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden
  granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and
  furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble
  seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they
  were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor,
  and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have
  robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.

EMPEROR. You would not have me sign?

CULTURE. I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a
  looking-glass too long.

EMPEROR. I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your
  banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.

CULTURE. My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your
  weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I
  have many homes, and the fairest is in France.

EMPEROR. If that were true, Germany would care less for you.

CULTURE. If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no
  single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German
  make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your
  heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you
  say you fight for me. Find some other reason.

EMPEROR. The jealousies of nations----

CULTURE. All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root
  of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others
  want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them?
  Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry:
  "The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."

EMPEROR. Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from
  on high.

CULTURE. Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.

EMPEROR. All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine
  for war the world has forged.

CULTURE. I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a
  Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?

EMPEROR. France invades little Belgium.

CULTURE. Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you
  at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great
  opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down.
  Beware of Belgium!

  (_She goes. He is left in two minds. He crosses to sign. He flings
    down the pen. He strikes the bell. CHANCELLOR and OFFICER
    reappear._)

CHANCELLOR. Your Imperial Majesty has signed?

EMPEROR. Thus (_he tears the paper_).

OFFICER. Sire!

EMPEROR. Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So
  long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.

OFFICER. But, Sire----

EMPEROR. You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.

CHANCELLOR. You were the friend of Austria.

EMPEROR. I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on
  every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her
  terms.

CHANCELLOR. Nay, Sire----

EMPEROR. And so, there will be no war.

OFFICER. Sire, we beg----

EMPEROR. These are my commands.

  (_They have to go, chagrined, but deferential._)

EMPEROR. The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That
  be my zenith!

  (_He goes back to the chair; he sleeps peacefully; in the distance a
    bell tolls the Angelus, and suddenly this is broken by one boom of a
    great gun, which reverberates and should be startling. The SPIRIT
    OF CULTURE returns, now with a wound in her breast; she surveys him
    sadly._)

CULTURE. Sleep on, unhappy King. (_He grows restless._) Better to wake
  if even your dreams appal you.

  (_He wakes, and for a moment he scarcely understands that he has
    been dreaming; the realization is tragic to him._)

EMPEROR. You! You have come here to mock me!

CULTURE. Oh, no.

EMPEROR. I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I
  forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it
  was before the war.

CULTURE. It was you who made the war, O Emperor!

EMPEROR (_huskily_). Belgium?

CULTURE. There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests
  a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.

EMPEROR. I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.

CULTURE. It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid
  waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of
  war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may
  dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by
  smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of
  mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of
  innocents.

EMPEROR. In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would
  not fight.

CULTURE. She fought you where CrÃ©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo,
  with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their
  ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they
  cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon
  their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown
  degenerate, but you, _you_, have made her great.

EMPEROR. France, Russia?

CULTURE. They are here around your walls.

EMPEROR. My people?

CULTURE. I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of
  your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.

EMPEROR. Do they curse me?

CULTURE. None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done
  your bidding.

EMPEROR. The women curse me?

CULTURE. Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their
  Father and could do no wrong.

EMPEROR. And you?

CULTURE. I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you
  farewell.

EMPEROR. God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.

CULTURE. If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed.
  Farewell.

  (_She is going. She lifts a pistol from the table and puts it in his
    hand. It is all she can do for her old friend. She goes away with
    shining eyes. The penny dip burns low. The great Emperor is lost in
    its shadows._)

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
