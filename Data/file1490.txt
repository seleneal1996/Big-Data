INTRODUCTORY NOTE


THERE is one question upon which the critics and lovers of Dickens seem
never able to get into agreement, and that is the question of the
original illustrations to his works. To the thorough-going enthusiast
Phiz and Dickens seem inseparable, and no edition which does not contain
the old, familiar grotesques of Hablot Browne's imagination, or, in the
earlier volume, the equally abnormal lineaments portrayed by Cruikshank
or Seymour, would be deemed worthy of a place upon his bookshelf. But a
younger generation is growing up, for whom the time-honoured pictures
have not the charm of long association, and among them it is common to
hear the complaint that the natural humour and pathos of the author's
best works are spoiled to modern fancy by the violent caricatures of the
illustrator. "Let us abolish these pictures altogether," they say: "and
illustrate the books with pretty conventionalities by more fashionable
artists." At the opposite pole stands yet another group of critics--the
"Superior People" who have made up their minds that Dickens himself was
a caricaturist, and that therefore the early illustrations, even if they
do a little emphasise his exaggerations, are only conceived in fitting
harmony with a world of fancy which drowns itself in excesses of the
grotesque. Among so many doctors, and all so emphatic, who shall decide?
It is, at any rate, no easy task.

It happens, however, that there does exist a series of Dickens
illustrations, now in some danger of being unduly neglected, in which
the artists were wonderfully happy in preserving the original features
of Phiz and Cruikshank's interpretations, while they toned down the more
extravagant details and brought imagination into closer harmony with
reality. These were the illustrations to the square-shaped "Household
Edition," published in 1870, just after the great novelist's death--and
now reissued in this Dickens picture-book, in the hope that those who
love the stories may like to possess in separate form what is, perhaps,
the best pictorial accompaniment that the novels ever received. At the
time of its first publication, the "Household Edition" enjoyed an
enormous success. At the moment the name of Dickens was on every one's
lips, and the fact that this splendidly illustrated reprint was issued
in penny numbers and sixpenny parts placed it within reach of even the
most humbly stocked purse. Its sale was stupendous, and the familiar
green-covered pamphlets percolated through every town and village where
the English tongue is spoken. The original copies may still be met with,
under many a country timbered roof, carefully treasured as one of the
most cherished household possessions.

Undoubtedly, a great part of the success was due to the art of the
illustrators. To begin with, there was an unusually liberal display of
pictures--the edition, as a whole, containing close upon nine hundred.
But more important than the number were the truth and sincerity of the
interpretations--qualities which helped to give a new life to characters
already secure of immortality. First and foremost, of course, the
edition will always be associated with the memory of Fred Barnard, whose
pictures are the outstanding feature of the present volume. Barnard
seemed destined by nature to illustrate Dickens; the spirit of "Boz" ran
again in his veins. And nothing in his work is more impressively
ingenious than the skill with which he took the types already created by
his predecessors, preserved their characteristics, so that each was
unmistakably himself, and yet by the illuminating touch of genius
transferred them every one from the realm of caricature to that of
portraiture. Not far inferior to him was that admirable draughtsman,
Charles Green, who exactly adopted Barnard's attitude to the originals.
The reader who will compare Green's illustrations to "The Old Curiosity
Shop" with Phiz's, will scarcely fail to notice with interest how often
Green has chosen the same subject as his predecessor, and all but
treated it in the same manner, save that a twisted grotesque suddenly
becomes, under the magic of his wand, a natural human being. His picture
of Sally Brass and the Marchioness is a remarkable instance in point:
but there are many others equally eloquent of his sympathetic and
interpretative method. Nor should the work of Mahony, A. B. Frost,
Gordon Thomson and others be forgotten, for each in his own way has
helped to make this volume, what its publishers confidently claim it to
be, a collection of Dickens pictures unrivalled for humour, pathos,
character, and interpretative skill. In the certainty that such a
gallery of good work can hardly fail to find appreciators, the volume is
now offered to all lovers of the most widely popular author of the
Victorian Era.

HOW OLD THAT FINE BOY WAS? "FOUR YEAR, JUST TURNED, SIR," SAID MRS.

RATHER SICKLY." SHE TENDERLY HUSHED THE BABY IN HER ARMS AS SHE SAID
IT--Book 1, chap. xi.]

[Illustration: THE PARLOUR FIRE TICKED IN THE GRATE. THERE WAS ONLY ONE
PERSON ON THE PARLOUR HEARTH, AND THE LOUD WATCH IN HIS POCKET TICKED

SOFTLY, THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN HEARD; AND HE CONSEQUENTLY STOOD, WITHIN
THE DOOR SHE HAD CLOSED, UNNOTICED--Book 1, chap. xiii.]

[Illustration: HIS DOOR WAS SOFTLY OPENED, AND THESE SPOKEN WORDS
STARTLED HIM, AND CAME AS IF THEY WERE AN ANSWER, "LITTLE DORRIT"--Book
1, chap. xiii.]

[Illustration: THEY WENT TO THE CLOSED GATE, AND PEEPED THROUGH INTO THE
COURTYARD. "I HOPE HE IS SOUND ASLEEP," SAID LITTLE DORRIT, KISSING ONE

LIKE A COMPANION, THAT THEY PUT DOWN MAGGY'S BASKET IN A CORNER TO SERVE
FOR A SEAT, AND KEEPING CLOSE TOGETHER, RESTED THERE FOR SOME TIME--Book
1, chap. xiv.]

[Illustration: THEN THE BELL RANG ONCE MORE, AND THEN ONCE MORE, AND

DON'T! GOOD-BYE, JOHN. GOD BLESS YOU!" "GOOD-BYE, MISS AMY. GOOD-BYE!"
AND SO HE LEFT HER--Book 1, chap, xviii.]

[Illustration: AS SHE STOOD BEHIND HIM, LEANING OVER HIS CHAIR SO
LOVINGLY, HE LOOKED WITH DOWNCAST EYES AT THE FIRE. AN UNEASINESS STOLE
OVER HIM THAT WAS LIKE A TOUCH OF SHAME; AND WHEN HE SPOKE, AS HE
PRESENTLY DID, IT WAS IN AN UNCONNECTED AND EMBARRASSED MANNER--Book 1,
chap. xix.]

[Illustration: THEY SPOKE NO MORE, ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE LODGING WHERE

THE ROOM--Book 1, chap. xx.]

[Illustration: ARTHUR CLENNAM WITH THE CARD IN HIS HAND, BETOOK HIMSELF

[Illustration: "WHAT NIMBLE FINGERS YOU HAVE," SAID FLORA, "BUT ARE YOU
SURE YOU ARE WELL?" ... "OH YES, INDEED!" FLORA PUT HER FEET UPON THE

1, chap. xxiv.]

[Illustration: MOUNTING TO HIS ATTIC, ATTENDED BY MRS. PLORNISH AS
INTERPRETER, HE FOUND MR. BAPTIST WITH NO FURNITURE BUT HIS BED ON THE
GROUND, A TABLE AND A CHAIR, CARVING WITH THE AID OF A FEW SIMPLE TOOLS,
IN THE BLITHEST WAY POSSIBLE. "NOW, OLD CHAP," SAID MR. PANCKS, "PAY
UP!"--Book 1, chap. xxxiii.]

[Illustration: MR. DOYCE HAD BEEN TO TWICKENHAM TO PASS THE DAY. CLENNAM
HAD EXCUSED HIMSELF, MR. DOYCE WAS JUST COME HOME. HE PUT IN HIS HEAD AT
THE DOOR OF CLENNAM'S SITTING-ROOM TO SAY GOOD NIGHT. "COME IN, COME
IN!" SAID CLENNAM--Book 1, chap. xxvi.]

[Illustration: HE WAS SLOWLY RESUMING HIS WAY, WHEN HE SAW A FIGURE IN
THE PATH BEFORE HIM WHICH HE HAD, PERHAPS, ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH THE
EVENING AND ITS IMPRESSIONS. MINNIE WAS THERE ALONE--Book 1, chap.
xxviii.]

[Illustration: WHY SHE SHOULD THEN STOOP DOWN AND LOOK IN AT THE
KEY-HOLE OF THE DOOR, AS IF AN EYE WOULD OPEN IT, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT
TO SAY. FROM THIS POSTURE SHE STARTED SUDDENLY, WITH A HALF SCREAM,
FEELING SOMETHING ON HER SHOULDER. IT WAS THE TOUCH OF A HAND; OF A
MAN'S HAND--Book 1, chap. xxix.]

[Illustration: THE STRANGER, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS FITFUL
ILLUMINATION OF HIS VISAGE, LOOKED INTENTLY AND WONDERINGLY AT HIM--Book
1, chap. xxx.]

[Illustration: ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT MR. BLANDOIS'S ROOM, A BOTTLE OF PORT

TABLE BETWEEN THEM--Book 1, chap. xxx.]

[Illustration: THEY WERE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF THEIR DESTINATION, WHEN,
AT THE CORNER OF HER OWN STREET, THEY CAME UPON FANNY, IN HER NEW
BONNET, BOUND FOR THE SAME PORT--Book 1, chap. xxxi.]

[Illustration: "DEAR LITTLE DORRIT, LET ME LAY IT DOWN." SHE YIELDED TO
HIM, AND HE PUT IT ASIDE! HER HANDS WERE THEN NERVOUSLY CLASPING
TOGETHER--Book 1, chap. xxxii.]

[Illustration: "WHAT A GOOD FELLOW YOU ARE, CLENNAM!" EXCLAIMED THE
OTHER STOPPING TO LOOK AT HIM, AS IF WITH IRREPRESSIBLE ADMIRATION.
"WHAT A CAPITAL FELLOW! YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED. THAT'S EASY TO
SEE."--Book 1, chap. xxxiv.]

[Illustration: WORN OUT WITH HER OWN EMOTIONS, AND YIELDING TO THE
SILENCE OF THE ROOM, HER HAND SLOWLY SLACKENED AND FAILED IN ITS FANNING
MOVEMENT, AND HER HEAD DROPPED DOWN ON THE PILLOW AT HER FATHER'S SIDE.
CLENNAM ROSE SOFTLY, OPENED AND CLOSED THE DOOR WITHOUT A SOUND--Book 1,
chap. xxxv.]

[Illustration: THROUGH THESE SPECTATORS, THE LITTLE PROCESSION, HEADED
BY THE TWO BROTHERS, MOVED SLOWLY TO THE GATE. MR. DORRIT, YIELDING TO
THE VAST SPECULATION HOW THE POOR CREATURES WERE TO GET ON WITHOUT HIM,
WAS GREAT, AND SAD, BUT NOT ABSORBED--Book 1, chap. xxxvi.]

[Illustration: "PERMIT ME!" SAID THE TRAVELLER, RISING AND HOLDING THE
DOOR OPEN. "GOOD REPOSE! TO THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU ONCE MORE! TO
TO-MORROW!" AS HE KISSED HER HAND, WITH HIS BEST MANNER, AND HIS
DAINTIEST SMILE, THE YOUNG LADY DREW A LITTLE NEARER TO HER FATHER, AND
PASSED HIM WITH A DREAD OF TOUCHING HIM--Book 2, chap. i.]

[Illustration: NEVERTHELESS, AS THEY WOUND ROUND THE RUGGED WAY WHILE
THE CONVENT WAS YET IN SIGHT, SHE MORE THAN ONCE LOOKED ROUND, AND
DESCRIED MR. BLANDOIS, BACKED BY THE CONVENT SMOKE WHICH ROSE HIGH FROM
THE CHIMNEYS IN A GOLDEN FILM, ALWAYS STANDING ON ONE JUTTING POINT
LOOKING DOWN AFTER THEM--Book 2, chap. iii.]

[Illustration: "IT OUGHT TO BRING A JUDGMENT ON US. BROTHER, I PROTEST
AGAINST IT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD!" AS HIS HAND WENT ABOVE HIS HEAD AND
CAME DOWN UPON THE TABLE, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BLACKSMITH'S--Book 2,
chap. v.]

[Illustration: LITTLE DORRIT WAS IN FRONT, WITH HER BROTHER AND MRS.
GENERAL (MR. DORRIT HAD REMAINED AT HOME). BUT ON THE BRINK OF THE QUAY,
THEY ALL CAME TOGETHER. SHE STARTED AGAIN TO FIND BLANDOIS CLOSE TO HER,
HANDING FANNY INTO THE BOAT--Book 2, chap. vi.]

[Illustration: "GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE! GOOD-BYE!" THE LAST WORDS WERE SPOKEN
ALOUD AS THE VIGILANT BLANDOIS STOPPED, TURNED HIS HEAD, AND LOOKED AT
THEM FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE--Book 2, chap. vii.]

[Illustration: HE STOPPED AT THE CORNER, SEEMING TO LOOK BACK
EXPECTANTLY UP THE STREET AS IF HE HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH SOME ONE
TO MEET HIM THERE; BUT HE KEPT A CAREFUL EYE ON THE THREE. WHEN THEY
CAME TOGETHER, THE MAN TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND MADE MISS WADE A BOW--Book
2, chap. ix.]

[Illustration: "DESPATCH THEN! ACHIEVE THEN! BRING MR. FLINTWINCH!
ANNOUNCE ME TO MY LADY!" CRIED THE STRANGER, CLANKING ABOUT THE STONE
FLOOR. "PRAY TELL ME, AFFERY," SAID ARTHUR ALOUD AND STERNLY, AS HE
SURVEYED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH INDIGNATION, "WHO IS THIS
GENTLEMAN?"--Book 2, chap. x.]

[Illustration: THERE IS A CURTAIN, MORE DIRT-COLOURED THAN RED, WHICH

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
