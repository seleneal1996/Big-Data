INTRODUCTORY REMARKS


    The Art of Biography
    Is different from Geography.
    Geography is about Maps,
    But Biography is about Chaps.

SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN


    Sir Christopher Wren
    Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
    "If anybody calls
    "Say I am designing St. Paul's."

[Illustration]




MIGUEL DE CERVANTES


    The people of Spain think Cervantes
    Equal to half-a-dozen Dantes:
    An opinion resented most bitterly
    By the people of Italy.

[Illustration]




GEORGE BERNARD SHAW


    Mr Bernard Shaw
    Was just setting out for the war,
    When he heard it was a dangerous trade
    And demonstrably underpaid.

[Illustration]




SIR HUMPHREY DAVY


    Sir Humphrey Davy
    Abominated gravy.
    He lived in the odium
    Of having discovered Sodium.

[Illustration]




J. S. MILL


    John Stuart Mill,
    By a mighty effort of will,
    Overcame his natural bonhomie
    And wrote "Principles of Political Economy."

[Illustration]




FRANÇOIS LISZT


    The Abbé Liszt
    Hit the piano with his fist.
    That was the way
    He used to play.

[Illustration]




LORD CLIVE


    What I like about Clive
    Is that he is no longer alive.
    There is a great deal to be said
    For being dead.

[Illustration]




KING EDWARD THE CONFESSOR


    Edward the Confessor
    Slept under the dresser.
    When that began to pall,
    He slept in the hall.

[Illustration]




 THE REV. JOHN CLIFFORD
 M.A., LL.B., D.D.


    Dr Clifford
    And I have differed.
    He disapproves of gin:
    I disapprove of sin.

[Illustration]




MESSRS CHAPMAN & HALL


    Chapman & Hall
    Swore not at all.
    Mr Chapman's yea was yea,
    And Mr Hall's nay was nay.

[Illustration]




KARL MARX


    Karl Marx
    Was completely wrapped up in his sharks.
    The poor creatures seriously missed him
    While he was attacking the capitalist system.

[Illustration]




OTTO THE GREAT


    The great Emperor Otto
    Could not decide upon a motto.
    His mind wavered between
    "L'Etat C'est Moi" and "Ich Dien."

[Illustration]




MARCONI


    Guglielmo Marconi
    Was brought up on macaroni,
    But when he gets it now
    There's no end of a row.

[Illustration]




DAVID HUME


    That you have all heard of Hume
    I tacitly assume;
    But you didn't know, perhaps,
    That his parents were Lapps.

[Illustration]




MR H. BELLOC


    Mr Hilaire Belloc
    Is a case for legislation ad hoc.
    He seems to think nobody minds
    His books being all of different kinds.

[Illustration]




JOB


    It is understood that Job
    Never read "The Globe;"
    But nothing could be higher than
    His opinion of Leviathan.

[Illustration]




PIZARRO


    The views of Pizarro
    Were perhaps a little narrow.
    He killed the Caciques
    Because (he said) they were sneaks.

[Illustration]




 THE DUKE OF FIFE
 K.T., P.C., G.C.V.O.


    It looked bad when the Duke of Fife
    Left off using a knife;
    But people began to talk
    When he left off using a fork.

[Illustration]




THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON


    The great Duke of Wellington
    Reduced himself to a skellington.
    He reached seven stone two,
    And then----Waterloo!

[Illustration]




JOHN BUNYAN


    I do not extenuate Bunyan's
    Intemperate use of onions,
    But if I knew a wicked ogress
    I would lend her "The Pilgrim's Progress."

[Illustration]




GEORGE HIRST


    When I faced the bowling of Hirst
    I ejaculated, "Do your worst!"
    He said, "Right you are, Sid."
    ----And he did.

[Illustration]




ERASMUS AND THE HUMANISTS


    After dinner, Erasmus
    Told Colet not to be "blas'mous"
    Which Colet, with some heat,
    Requested him to repeat.

[Illustration]




BESANT AND RICE


    Sir (then Mr) Walter Besant
    Would never touch pheasant,
    But Mr James Rice
    Thought it so nice.

[Illustration]




TIZIANO VECELLI


    When the great Titian
    Was in a critical condition,
    He was carefully nursed
    By Francis the First.

PROFESSOR JAMES DEWAR, F.R.S.


    Professor Dewar
    Is a better man than you are.
    None of you asses
    Can condense gases.

[Illustration]




SIR WALTER RALEIGH


    Sir Walter Raleigh
    Bickered down the valley.
    But he could do better than the rill,
    For he could bicker up-hill.

[Illustration]




JANE AUSTEN


    The novels of Jane Austen
    Are the ones to get lost in.

           *       *       *       *       *

    I wonder if Labby
    Has read "Northanger Abbey?"

[Illustration]




ODO OF BAYEUX


    Archbishop Odo
    Was just in the middle of "Dodo,"
    When he remembered that it was Sunday.
    "Sic transit gloria mundi."

[Illustration]




DAVID RICARDO


    The intrepid Ricardo
    With characteristic bravado,
    Alluded openly to Rent
    Wherever he went.

[Illustration]




SIR THOMAS À MALLORY

    Sir Thomas à Mallory
    Always went to the gallery.
    He said, not without nous,
    That it was the best place in the house.

[Illustration]




MR ALFRED BEIT


    Mr Alfred Beit
    Screamed suddenly in the night.
    When they asked him why
    He made no reply.

[Illustration]




CIMABUE


    When they told Cimabue
    He didn't know how to cooee,
    He replied, "Perhaps I mayn't,
    But I do know how to paint."

[Illustration]




PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT


    If only Mr Roosevelt
    Knew how officers in the Blues felt,
    He wouldn't be so rife
    With his Strenuous Life.

[Illustration]




ROBERT HARLEY, EARL OF OXFORD


    People wondered why Harley
    Sang "Wae's me for Prince Charlie."
    "It is childish," they said, "to mourn
    For a person not yet born."

[Illustration]




SIR ALEXANDER FULLER ACLAND-HOOD, M.P.


    Sir Alexander Acland-Hood
    Believed in Free Food:

EDVARD GRIEG


    The musician Grieg
    Joined the Primrose League.
    It gave him the idea of his chorus,
    "The Unburied Ichthyosaurus."

[Illustration]




JAN VAN EYCK


    The younger Van Eyck
    Was christened Jan, and not Mike.
    The thought of this curious mistake
    Often kept him awake.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
