    _To my anonymous worthy Friend, Physician and Philosopher, whose
    Name, for certain Reasons, I forbear to mention._


  _SIR_,

I CANNOT, without great Ingratitude, forget the friendly Visits and
kind Advice I frequently receiv'd from you, during, not only, a
dangerous but tedious Indisposition, which surprisingly seiz'd me in
the Year 1717, and, notwithstanding your extraordinary Care as well
as unquestionable Judgment, continu'd upon me till the latter end of
the Year --25; in which long interval of Time, the Attendance you gave
me, and the Trouble you gave yourself, abstracted from all Interest,
made you truly sensible of my unhappy Condition, and myself equally
apprehensive of the great Obligations I shall ever be under to so
sincere a Friend.

THE first occasion of my Illness, as I have good reason to imagine,
was a very shocking Surprize given me by certain Persons, who
pretended to be my Friends in a considerable Affair then depending,
wherein their Treachery threaten'd me with succeeding Ruin, had not
Providence interpos'd and deliver'd the Oppress'd from the cruel
hands of such deceitful Enemies: Upon whose hard Usage, and the news
of my Disappointment, I was struck at first with a kind of Epilepsy
and depriv'd of all my Senses in an Instant, drop'd down in a publick
Coffee-House, under violent Agitations, which, it seems, are generally
concomitant with this miserable Distemper; but being luckily assisted
and kindly supported by some Gentlemen present, I happen'd to escape
those ill Consequences that might otherwise have attended me, during
the extremity of my Convulsions, which were reported, by those
that held me, to be so strong as to be almost insupportable, till
the Paroxism declin'd, which terminated in a cold Sweat, Trembling
and Weeping, and this was the first Attack that ever this terrible
Assailant made upon me; tho' afterwards he forc'd himself into a
further familiarity with me (much against my Will) nor could your kind
Endeavours, by the Art of Physick, back'd with my own strength of
Constitution, fright away this evil Companion from me, till my good
Genius, by the direction of Providence, communicated a particular
Secret to me, which, with God's Blessing, has lately prov'd my
Deliverance, in what manner, before I conclude, I shall very freely
acquaint you, in hopes you will favour me with your candid Opinion in
answer thereunto.

NEAR eight Years, was a long Time to continue under the frequent
returns and uncomfortable dread of such a shocking Affliction, which,
upon every little disorder of Mind or disappointment in Business,
never fail'd to visit me; till, by convulsive or involuntary Motions
in my Head and other Parts of my Body, my Eyes were bury'd in their
Sockets, my other Features contracted, my Limbs often distorted, my
Bowels sometimes wrack'd with intolerable Pains, and all the Faculties
of my Mind so greatly weaken'd and impair'd, that I, who, for many
Years before, had been esteem'd as an Oracle, by the most Polite and
Curious part of both Sexes, was now, for want of strength of Mind and
ability of Body to imploy my Talent and excercise my Art as usual,
treated like an old Soldier, who had lost his Limbs in the Service of
his Country, and thought only worthy, by way of requital, to be made
a hobbling Pensioner in some starving Hospital; but, I thank my Stars,
it prov'd not quite so bad with me, for tho' some Ladies were too hasty
and importunate to bear with the least disappointment or admit of any
delay, without shewing their resentment, or refusing to trust their
Money till my Convulsions afforded me a rational Interval, wherein I
might be able to give them ample Satisfaction: Yet, others, of a more
considerate, easy and compassionate Temper, were so highly concern'd
for my too apparent Indisposition, that, in order to drive out this
tormenting Demon that possess'd me, they brought me all the old
Recipes they could muster up among their crazy Aunts and Grandmothers,
practis'd upon all Occasions in their several Families, perhaps ever
since the Times of _Galen_ and _Hippocrates_, but, having been long
under the Care and Friendship of so able a Physician as your self, tho'
to little or no purpose, I could nor put Faith enough in old Womens
Medicines to receive Benefit thereby, so, under a kind of despondency
of every thing but Providence, I suffer'd my Distemper to take its own
Course, till my Fits encreas'd upon me, to at least twenty in a Day,
and by their frequent reiterations brought, at length, such a dimness
upon my Sight, such a weakness in my Joints, and tremor upon my Nerves,
that render'd me incapable of all manner of Business, especially that
which I had so long profess'd and successfully perform'd, to the full
Satisfaction and great Astonishment of Thousands; but being now unable
to Write; and, for want of Speech, having no other way of communicating
my Answers to the demands of the Ladies and Gentlemen that apply'd
themselves to me, except by Digitation, which they understood not, I
was forc'd sometimes, when much disorder'd by my Convulsions, to send
'em away dissatisfy'd, which, if it were any Mortification to them,
prov'd a much greater to my self, because, upon my ready performances
in the Mystery I am Master of, depends the welfare of my whole Family.

UNDER these unhappy Circumstances I labour'd till the Month of
_October_, in the Year --24, confin'd by my Distemper to my own
Habitation, not daring to go abroad for fear of falling in the Streets,
having been before surpriz'd by my Fits in St. _James_'s Park and
several other Places; but, about this Time, being possess'd with a
strong Inclination to the Cold-Bath, near Sir _John Oldcastle_'s, and
the great desire I had to experience the same, being highly encourag'd
by your Advice and Approbation, I summon'd all the Strength I had to my
Assistance, and pursuant to the Dictates of my own restless Mind, had
recourse thither accordingly, attended by a proper Person to take due
Care of me, for fear of the worst.

I had not repeated this cold Expedient above twice or thrice, but I was
sensible of the Benefits I receiv'd thereby, for my Distemper began to
treat me with less severity than usual, and my Fits were succeeded with
a greater Defluction of Tears than what was common, before I apply'd
my self to the Bath, so that, after my Weeping was over, I found my
self much refresh'd and all my Faculties abundantly more alert, than
at any Time they had been since my first Illness, insomuch, that,
from a timely continuance of this external Application, I entertain'd
great hopes of a perfect Recovery; but, notwithstanding my diligent
Prosecution of this sharp and shivering Method, I was, to my great
Sorrow, unhappily disappointed; for my Convulsions were as frequent,
tho' not so violent as formerly, and I was now again divested of all
hopes of Relief, except by the Hand of Providence, having nothing to
trust to, but that infallible Physician who can Cure all things in an
Instant.

THE Despondency I was now under of any Assistance from humane Art, and
the slender Opinion you seem'd to entertain of my Recovery, made my
Intervals as Melancholy as my Fits were troublesome; oppress'd with
these hard Circumstances, I supported a burthensome Life, and drag'd
on the tedious Hours till the latter end of the Year --25, about which
Time, as I was slumbering one Morning in my Bed, after a restless
Night, my good _Genius_ or Guardian Angel, Cloth'd in a white Surplice
like a singing Boy, appear'd before me, holding a Scrowle or Label
in his right Hand, whereon the following Words were wrote in large
Capitals.

    _READ, BELIEVE AND PRACTISE, THE LOADSTONE SHALL BE YOUR CURE, WITH
    AN ADDITION OF THE POWDER HERE PRESCRIB'D YOU; BUT KEEP THE LAST AS
    A SECRET; FOR WITH THAT AND THE MAGNET YOU SHALL RELIEVE NUMBERS
    IN DISTRESS, AND LIVE TO DO GREATER WONDERS THAN YOU HAVE HITHERTO
    PERFORM'D; THEREFORE BE OF GOOD CHEAR, FOR YOU HAVE A FRIEND
    UNKNOWN, WHO, IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE, WILL NEVER FAIL YOU._

THIS comfortable News, tho' deliver'd to me after so surprizing a
manner, yet, was it very welcome to a languishing Person under a
complication of Misfortunes, notwithstanding I had a great struggle
with my natural Reason, before I could convince my self of what I was
yet confident my very Eyes had seen, or at least had been represented
to me after an extraordinary manner, for betwixt really seeing what we
call a Vision or verily believing we do see it, there is but a slender
difference; however, the intire Confidence I had put in Providence, and
the great desire I had to be reliev'd, were to me convincing Arguments,
beyond all Objection, that my Guardian Angel had actually appear'd and
communicated to my Eyes the very Scrowle that I had read, the Words of
which, lest my Memory should have prov'd treacherous, I enter'd in my
Pocket-Book as they are before recited, the Recipe only excepted.

HAVING thus subjected my Reason to my Senses, or at least my Faith,
for I either saw or believ'd I saw what I have here reported, I had
nothing else to do, but to put in Practice the Receipt which my good
_Genius_ had imparted to me, tho' how to come at a Loadstone, seem'd to
me as difficult as to find out the Philosopher's Stone, having but a
slender Knowledge of the thing it self, and much less of its Virtues;
however, upon enquiry, I soon found out a certain Virtuoso, near
_Moorfields_, who is an eminent dealer in such sort of Curiosities, and
by his Assistance I presently furnish'd my self with what I wanted, and
sending for some fat Amber and a certain preparation of Steel, which
I privately dispens'd in a very particular manner, according to the
_Recipe_ communicated by my _Genius_; then applying both as directed,
was miraculously deliver'd, in a great measure, from those wracking
Convulsions which had so long afflicted me, and in less than a Month's
Time my whole Microcosm was restor'd to such a happy State of Health,
Strength and Vivacity, that Heaven be prais'd, I could do any thing as
usual, but, if I leave off my Loadstone for two or three Days, which
I have sometimes done, meerly out of Curiosity, my Fits, as yet, will
remind me of my foolish Presumption, and force me to have recourse to
my wonderful Preservative, which has not only prov'd so great a friend
to my self, but has reliev'd others in the like distress; and as I have
found by three or four late Experiments, is as effectual in suppresing
Vapours and removing or preventing Hysterick Fits in Women, as it is
in Epilepsies and Convulsions in our own Sex, either Men or Children.

NOW, Doctor, since I have happily conquer'd so stubborn an Enemy, by
such miraculous means, as do not fail to afflict others as well as
my self, I desire you will vouchsafe me your real Sentiments of this
uncommon way of Cure, your Notions of the _Genii_, and the wonderful
manner of communicating the _Recipe_, your Thoughts of the Loadstone
and the Virtues thereof, your Opinion of Sympathy and the Cures
perform'd thereby, for I know you are Philosopher sufficient, as well
as Physician, to give a very good light into all these Mysteries, in
which I own I am to seek; therefore hope you will condescend so far as
to spend a leisure Hour upon the foregoing Particulars, and you will
infinitely oblige,

  _Sir_,
  _Your assured Friend_,
  _and humble Servant_,
  Duncan Campbel.

    _To my Deaf and Dumb Friend, Mr._ Duncan Campbel, _in Answer to his
    Letter to an anonymous worthy Friend, Physician and Philosopher_.


  _SIR_,

I RECEIV'D your Letter and read the same, with no less Surprise than
Satisfaction; for, as I am greatly pleas'd at your miraculous Recovery,
so, I am equally astonish'd at the wonderful Means by which it was
obtain'd; I confess, I have been too great a Student in Physick and
natural Philosophy, to entertain any extraordinary Opinion of Miracles,
no ways accountable to human Reason, except those that concern
Religion, which are brought down to our Knowledge well attested and
recommended to our Faith by unexceptionable Authorities; not, but,
that I am ready to admit, that the Power of Healing is in the Hand of
Providence, and that some Patients, when their Distempers, thro' the
frailty of humane Judgment, derive their Essence from so obscure an
Original that even puzzles the Physician, I am free to acknowledge,
especially when the Blessing of God accompanies the Administration,
that the most trifling application in the Eyes of Art, may recover such
Persons from the most dangerous Infirmities: This, I look upon to be
your extraordinary Case, and therefore think not the means to which you
ascribe your Cure or the manner of the _Recipe_'s being communicated to
you, a proper subject for a Physical Enquiry, unless you had sent me
the Prescription of your _Genius_, which I understand by your Letter,
you are oblig'd to conceal, and then perhaps I should have been able
to have judg'd, in some measure, which of the Applications are most
Essential, the Powder or the Loadstone, also how far your Guardian
Angel is a Regular Proficient in the modern Practise of Physick.

HOWEVER, as you desire my Opinion of the _Genii_, the Loadstone, the
Powder of Sympathy, and the like, I shall not be only willing to give
you my own Thoughts, but the Sentiments of others, before I take my
leave, who have made the foregoing Particulars their principal Studies,
and are therefore better acquainted with the nature of Spirits, than I
pretend to be.

AS for _Genii_ or familiar Spirits, good and bad, believ'd and
reported, by the most Wise and Learned of the Ancients, to attend
Mankind, and the various Operations they have had upon humane Minds
as well as Bodies, I cannot but confess, seem very wonderful to
my defective Understanding; yet, when we observe what innumerable
Instances have been handed to us by the most reputable Authors, both
Antique and Modern, attested from Time to Time by unquestionable
Authorities, who, that, before he div'd into these Mysteries, look'd
upon the same to be Whimsy, can forbear staggering in his Opinion?

THE most celebrated Instance of a _Genius_ among the Ancients, is that
of _Socrates_, one of the wisest of the Philosophers in the Age he
liv'd in, and that he had such a familiar Spirit to attend him, which
the _Greeks_ call'd _DÃ¦mon_, and the _Latins Genius_, is sufficiently
testify'd by three of his Contemporaries, _viz._ _Plato_, _Xenophon_
and _Antisthenes_, also further confirm'd by _Laertius_, _Plutarch_,
_Maximus Tyrius_, _Dion_, _Chrysostomus_, _Cicero_, _Apuleius_, and
_Facinas_; besides others more Modern, as, _Tertullian_, _Origen_,
_Clemens Alexandrinus_, &c. but that which is of greater Authority than
all the Vouchers aforemention'd, is what _Socrates_ says of himself,
in _Plato's Theage_, viz. _By some Divine Lot, I have a certain_
DÃ¦mon, _which has follow'd me from my Childhood, as an Oracle_; _and
this Voice_, says he, for so he terms it, _whenever it speaks to me,
disswades me from engaging in what I am about to put in Action, but
never prompts me to attempt any thing_. This, I presume, might be the
chief Reason, why _Socrates_ persu'd not his own Inclinations, which
were naturally Vicious, as himself confess'd to the Physiognomist, but
was always accompany'd with a divine Spirit that restrain'd him from
it; for, in speaking to _Alcibiades_, a vicious Noble Man of _Athens_,
but reclaim'd by _Socrates_; says he, _My Tutor_ (meaning the Spirit
that attended him) _is wiser and better than you_. And to further shew,
that what he call'd his _DÃ¦mon_, was something more than a secret
Impulse of the Mind, or Dictates of a good Conscience, _Theocritus_
affirms in _Plutarch_, that a Vision attended _Socrates_ from his
Childhood, going before him and guiding him in all the Actions of his
Life, being a constant light to him in such Affairs as lay not within
the reach of humane standing, and that the Spirit often spoke to him,
divinely governing and inspiring his Intentions. A thousand Instances
of the like nature, I could collect from the Ancients, to prove, that
what you have reported to me, in your Letter, may be no Delusion, but
real Fact, with all it's surprising Circumstances, could the Task be
compris'd within the compass of a Letter, but, a Treatise of this
nature, being much fitter for a Volume, I shall only proceed to a few
familiar Instances of a more modern Date, that your wonderful Cure may
gain Credit with the Publick, because I know your Sincerity.

FROISSARD reports, That in the Time of _Edward_ the Third, there
was a certain Knight in _France_, call'd _Corasse_, who could tell
every thing Transacted throughout the whole World, in a Day or two at
the most, were the distance never so remote, and this he did by an
invisible Intelligencer or familiar Spirit, which he call'd _Orthone_,
who was always at his Command and brought him News continually for many
Years, till, at last, he lost the Benefit of so useful a Companion,
through a vain desire of gratifying his Curiousity after the following
manner, (_viz._) The Knight, having hitherto only heard the Voice of
his spiritual Emissary, was now infatuated with an earnest inclination
to behold his Shapes, which favour he requested of _Orthone_;
accordingly, whose Answer was, that the first thing he should see
on the morrow Morning, after he was risen from his Bed, should be
the Object he desir'd, or Words to that effect. The Knight, the next
Morning, pursuant to the direction of his Spirit, arose from his Bed,
look'd about him, but could not discover any thing worthy of Remark;
upon which disappointment, he upbraided _Orthone_, with being worse
than his Word, who reply'd he had kept his Promise, desiring the Knight
to remind himself of what he had first observ'd after his rising; the
Knight, upon recollection, reply'd, that he saw nothing uncommon, but
a couple of Straws tumbling upon the Ground and sporting with one
another, as if agitated by the Wind; _That was I_, saith the Spirit,
_and therefore I kept my Word_. Then the Knight desir'd to see him once
more, in such a Shape as might induce him, the next Time, to take more
notice of him, to which the Spirit consented, saying, _the first thing
you see to morrow Morning, after your uprising, shall be me again_;
accordingly, when the Time appointed was arriv'd and the Knight was
risen from his Bed, looking out of his Chamber Window, the first Object
he espy'd, was a Lean ill-favour'd Sow, so deform'd and ugly, that he
was not able to abide the sight of her; and not expecting _Orthone_
to appear to him in so homely a manner, he set his Dogs upon the Sow,
to drive her away, who being highly affronted at such unfriendly
usage, immediately Vanish'd, to the Knight's great surprise; and his
old acquaintance _Orthone_, never came near him after. This relation,
_Froissard_ asserts he had from the Knight's own Mouth, with whom he
was very intimate.

FROM hence I conclude, That the same sort of Spirit that attended
_Corasse_, has been always a Friend to you, not only of late, in your
miraculous Recovery, but has at all Times assisted you in Writing
the Names of Strangers, discovering the most secret Intrigues and
foretelling future Events, for which you have long been Famous. As a
further Proof of the Existence of Spirits and that at some other Times,
as well as in your Case, they have prescrib'd Physick to their living
Friends, I shall quote an Instance out of Mr. _Glanvil_'s _Reports_,
attested by the late Lord _Orrery_, the Famous Mr. _Greatrix_, and many
others, living in the Reign of King _Charles_ the Second.

A Gentleman in _Ireland_, near to the Earl of _Orrery_'s House, sending
his Butler one Afternoon to a neighbouring Village to buy Cards, as he
pass'd a Field, espy'd a Company in the middle thereof, sitting round
a Table, with several Dishes of good Cheer before them, and moving
towards 'em, they all arose and Saluted him, desiring him to sit down
and take part with them; but one of them whisper'd these Words in his
Ear, _viz._ _Do nothing this Company invites you to_: Whereupon, he
refusing to accept of their Kindness, the Table and all the Dainties
it was furnish'd with immediately vanish'd, but the Company fell to
Dancing and playing upon divers Musical Instruments, the Butler being
a second Time solicited to partake of their Diversions, but would not
be prevail'd upon to engage himself with them; upon which, they left
off their Merry-making and all fell to Work, still pressing the Butler
to make one among 'em, but to no purpose; so that, upon his third
refusal, they all vanish'd and left the Butler alone, who in a great
Consternation return'd home, without the Cards, fell into a Fit as he
enter'd the House, but, soon recovering his Senses, related to his
Master all that had pass'd.

THE following Night, one of the Ghostly Company came to the Butler's
Bed-side and told him, that if he offer'd to stir out the next Day, he
would be carry'd away; upon whose Advice, he kept within till towards
the Evening, and having then an Occasion to make Water, ventur'd to
set one Foot over the Threshold of the Door, in order to ease himself,
which he had no sooner done, but a Rope was cast about his Middle, in
the Sight of several Standers-by, and the poor Man was hurry'd from
the Porch with unaccountable Swiftness, follow'd by many Persons, but
they were not nimble enough to overtake him, till a Horseman, well
mounted, happening to meet him upon the Road, and seeing many followers
in pursuit of a Man hurry'd along in a Rope, without any Body to
force him, catch'd hold of the Cord and stop'd him in his Career, but
receiv'd, for his Pains, such a strap upon his Back with one End of
the Rope, as almost fell'd him from his Horse; however, being a good
Christian, he was too strong for the Devil, and recover'd the Butler
out of the Spirits Clutches and brought him back to his Friends.

THE Lord _Orrery_, hearing of these strange Passages, for his further
Satisfaction in the Truth thereof, sent for the Butler, with leave of
his Master, to come and continue some Days and Nights at his House,
which, in Obedience to his Lordship, the Servant did accordingly, who
after his first Night's Bedding there, reported to the Earl in the
Morning, that his Spectre had again been with him, and assur'd him,
that on that very Day he should be spirited away, in spight of all the
Measures that could possibly be taken to prevent it: Upon which, he
was conducted into a large Room, with a considerable Number of holy
Persons to defend him from the Assaults of Satan; among whom, was the
famous stroker of bewitch'd Persons, Mr. _Greatrix_, who liv'd in the
Neighbourhood, and knew, as may be presum'd, how to deal with the Devil
as well as any Body; besides several eminent Quality were present in
the House, among the rest, two Bishops, all waiting the wonderful Event
of this unaccountable Prodigy.

TILL part of the Afternoon was spent, the Time slid away in nothing
but Peace and Quietness, but, at length, the enchanted Patient was
perceiv'd to rise from the Floor without any visible Assistance,
whereupon, Mr. _Greatrix_ and another lusty Man clapt their Arms over
his Shoulders, and endeavour'd to weigh him down with their utmost
Strength, but to no purpose, for the Devil prov'd too powerful, and
after a hard struggle on both sides, made them quit their hold, and
snatching the Butler from 'em, carry'd him over their Heads and toss'd
him in the Air, to and fro, like a Dog in a Blanket; several of the
Company running under the poor Wretch to save him from the Ground, by
which means, when the Spirits Frolick was over, they could not find
that in all this hurry-scurry, the frighted Butler had receiv'd the
least Damage, but was left in _Statu quo_, upon the same Premises, to
prove the Devil a Liar.

THE Goblins, for this bout, having given over their Pastime, and left
their Maygame to take a little repose, that he might in some Measure be
refresh'd against their next Sally, My Lord order'd, the same Night,
two of his Servants to lie with him, for fear some Devil or other
should come and catch him Napping, notwithstanding which, the Butler
told his Lordship the next Morning, that the Spirit had again been
with him in the likeness of a Quack Doctor, and in his right Hand a
wooden Dish-full of grey Liquor, like a Mess of Porridge, at sight of
which, he endeavour'd to awake his Bedfellows, but the Spectre told him
his attempts were fruitless, for that his Companions were enchanted
into a deep Sleep, advising him not to be frighted, for he came as
a Friend, and was the same Spirit that caution'd him in the Field
against complying with the Company he there met, when he was going
for the Cards; adding, that if he had not refus'd to come into their
Measures, he had been for ever miserable; also wonder'd he had escap'd
the Day before, because he knew there was so powerful a Combination
against him; but assur'd him, that for the future there would be no
more attempts of the like Nature; further telling the poor trembling
Butler, that he knew he was sadly troubl'd with two sorts of Fits,
and, therefore, as a Friend, had brought him a Medicine that would
Cure him of both, beseeching him to take it, but the poor Patient, who
had been so scurvily us'd by these sort of Doctors, and fearing the
Devil might be at the Bottom of the Cup, would not be prevail'd upon to
swallow the Dose, which made the Spirit Angry; who told him, however,
he had a kindness for him, and that if he would bruise the Roots of
Plantane without the Leaves, and drink the the Juice thereof, it should
certainly Cure him of one sort of his Fits, but as a Punishment for
his Obstinacy in refusing the Liquor, he should carry the other to
his Grave, then the spiritual Doctor ask'd his Patient if he knew him;
the Butler answer'd, _No_. _I am_, says he, _the wandring Ghost of
your old Acquaintance_ John Hobby, _who has been dead and bury'd these
seven Years_; _and ever since, for the wickedness of my Life, have
been lifted into the Company of those Evil-Spirits you beheld in the
Fields, am hurry'd up and down in this restless Condition, and doom'd
to continue in the same wretched State till the Day of Judgment_.
Adding, that _Had you serv'd your Creator in the days of your Youth,
and offer'd up your Prayers that Morning, before you were sent for the
Cards, you had not been treated by the Spirits that tormented you, with
so much Rigour and Severity_.

AFTER the Butler had reported these marvellous Passages to my Lord and
his Family, the two Bishops, that were present, among other Quality,
were thereupon consulted, whether or no, it was proper for the Butler
to follow the Spirit's Advice, in taking Plantane Juice for the Cure of
his Fits, and whether he had done well or ill, in refusing the Liquid
Dose which the Spectre would have given him; the Question, at first,
seem'd to be a kind of moot Point, but, after some struggle in the
Debate, their Resolution was, that the Butler had acted, through the
whole Affair, like a good Christian, for that it was highly sinful to
follow the Devil's Advice in any thing, and that no Man should do Evil
that Good might come of it; so that, in short, the poor Butler, after
all his Fatigue, had no amends for his trouble, but was deny'd, by the
Bishops, the seeming Benefit that the Spirit intended him.

I do not introduce this old surprising Story to amuse you, but to let
you know, that it is no new thing for Spectres to turn Doctors to such
ailing Persons as they retain a Respect for, and that your _Genius_ was
not the first Spirit that ever practis'd Physick; therefore, if this
Narrative reported by _Glanvil_, _Beaumont_, and others, may obtain
Credit, upon the Authorities of my Lord _Orrery_, Mr. _Greatrix_,
and divers Persons, who were in a great measure Eye-Witnesses of the
matter, I see no Reason I have to doubt the Truth of your Letter, since
I know your Integrity; besides, it has always been allow'd by such
DÃ¦monologers as have Publish'd their Thoughts upon the visibility of
Spirits, that _Scotland_, is never without such a sort of People as
they call Second-sighted, who have not only the Power of discerning
Apparitions, but, by their frequent Conversation with Spirits, foretel
future Events, to the great Astonishment of all Persons that consult
them: That there are such sort of Diviners in the World, especially
in _Scotland_, I am throughly convinc'd; of which Number I take your
self to be one, but how to account for your mysterious Performances, I
readily confess, I know not, and therefore shall submit that Task to
such as are qualify'd with a more subtil Penetration.

I doubt I have tir'd your Patience with too much Prolixity upon
familiar Spirits, therefore, to make you amends, I will be but short
in my Dissertation upon the Loadstone; which in the first place, is,
a very ponderous Fossile, found in different Climates, and seems in
its Nature and Qualities to be nearly related to Iron Oar, from whence
it is endow'd with a peculiar property of drawing Iron to its self by
the Power of Sympathy, or the natural Disposition it has to Embrace
that particular Metal. In _Ãgypt_ there are large Mines of it, some
few Magnets have been found in _Ãthiopia_, which have attracted Iron
very forcibly; but two sorts are dug up at the foot of the _Sardinian_
Mountains, of such different Natures, that as one draws Iron, the other
will repel it; as you will find it reported by _Johannes Jonstonus_, in
his History of _Nature_, also by _Pliny_, in his Second Book, who, for
the aforesaid Reason, calls this Stone _Theamedes_: As to the singular
Virtues hitherto discover'd in the common Loadstone, the most admirable
of all are the strict Correspondence it maintains with the two Poles,
and the wonderful Property it communicates, by a touch, to the Needle,
for the Benefit of Mariners. The Power of its Attraction, is thought
by some Virtuosos to be owing to a clammy bituminous Substance, by
which the Contexture of the more solid Parts are closely semented and
confirm'd; to prove this, work a Loadstone in the Fire and it shall
cast forth a blewish Flame, like that of lighted Brimstone, and so
continue, till it spends its Life and loses the Power of Attraction.
There is a great deal of Sulphur in Iron as well as in the Loadstone,
which is the principal Cause of their Sympathising with each other,
and if you destroy the first in either, the last will fail in course,
which is the Reason, why the Loadstone will not attract the Rust of
Iron, tho' it will the Filings, because in the former, the bituminous
Matter is quite spent and nothing left but a kind of _Caput mortuum_.
The Loadstone hath also two Poles, which answer those in the Heavens,
if you touch the Needle with the North Pole of the Stone, it will
point to the Artick, if with the South part thereof, as it stood
posited in the Mine, it will point to the Antartick, but not with the
utmost exactness, except it stands in the Meridian: But to be further
satisfy'd in these Mysteries, have recourse to _Libavius_, _Cardanus_,
_Pliny_, _Bodin_, _Porta_, our own _Philosophical Transactions_, and
such Authors as have treated more largely upon this Subject: for, I
suppose, all that you want to know of me is, if ever I have heard from
others, or discover'd by my own Experience, any such Physical Virtue
in the Loadstone, as may tend to the Cure of any Chronical or other
Disease incident to humane Bodies, that may strengthen the Opinion you
seem to entertain of it in such Cases, from the Benefit your self has
lately receiv'd in so extraordinary a manner.

IN answer to this, I confess, I have heard it affirm'd (but not by a
Physician) that the Loadstone hath withdrawn the Inflamation and given
Ease in the Gout, and by changing the Application of it from one side
to the other, has at length chas'd it away, to the perfect recovery
of the Patient; but in any other Case, excepting your own, I never
heard of a Cure so much as facilitated or attempted to be perform'd
thereby; therefore, as the Use of it in any Disease is quite Foreign to
the common Practice of Physick, if others, as well as your self, have
receiv'd Benefit by this new Discovery, I think not my self oblig'd
to account for it, till it becomes practical among my own Fraternity,
and then it will be Time enough for any Physician to give his Thoughts
thereon; besides, I am a Stranger to the Preparation prescrib'd to you
by your _Genius_, and without the knowledge of that material Secret,
it is impossible for any Physician, in your Case, to make a clear
Judgment, or to know which of the two your Cure is chiefly owing to,
the Powder or the Loadstone; for how far the latter may operate upon
a Body prepar'd by _Pulvis Martis_ or other Chalybeates, I shall not
pretend to determine, tho', for ought I know, wonderful Cures may be
perform'd in that way, but upon what Reason in Nature, such a new
System can be founded, seems very remote from my present understanding;
but, since you are become sole Master of so wonderful a Secret, my
Advice is, that you keep the _Recipe_ to your self, in Obedience to
your _Genius_, and tho' you Assist others, never to do it without Fee
or Reward, for all useful Discoveries ought to be render'd Profitable.

IN answer to the last Article of your Request, I shall now proceed to
say something of Sympathy, and the Cures reported to have been done
thereby. The Sympathetick Powder, so highly esteem'd about a hundred
Years since, by Men of Art in this Kingdom, was first brought into
_Europe_ by a Religious _Carmelite_, who in his Travels thro' _India_,
_Persia_, and _China_, had made himself Master of this Secret, and from
some of those _Eastern_ Countries, came over into _Tuscany_, where he
perform'd many considerable Cures by this occult Method, to the great
Astonishment of the most eminent Physicians and Surgeons in those
Parts; insomuch that the Duke of _Tuscany_ himself was very desirous of
becoming Master of this surprizing _Arcanum_, but, the honest Fryar by
many handsome Excuses brought himself off, and would not be prevail'd
upon to communicate his _Nostrum_ to his Highness.

SOME few Months after this, our Famous _English_ Virtuoso, Sir _Kenelm
Digby_, happening in his Travels to be at the Grand Duke's Court, an
Opportunity fell accidentally in the Knight's way to do the Fryar a
Service, which the good old Man took so kindly at his hands, that
he recompenc'd the Curtesy with a Discovery of his Secret; and soon
after returning into _Persia_, left no Man in _Europe_ Master of the
same but Sir _Kenelm_, who was the first Person that brought the
_Recipe_ into _England_, and that here wrought Cures by it himself, and
recommended it to the Practice of others; so that, in a little Time,
every Mother-Midwife, and Country Fleabeard, became topping Surgeons,
especially for the Cure of Green-Wounds; for it is not to be trusted
to, in other Cases.

THIS Sympathetick Powder, by which many Miracles have been perform'd
at great Distances, is nothing more than the Simple Powder of _Roman
Vitriol_, either Chymically prepar'd, or imperfectly calcin'd in the
Beams of the Sun; from whence, 'tis said, it derives a very balsamick
Virtue; a little of this apply'd to any Instrument that has done
Mischief, or to a Rag dip'd into, or stain'd with, the Blood of a
Wound, never fails of Curing the Patient at the widest Distance,
provided the Wound be Curable.

SIR _Kenelm Digby_, to advance the Credit of this surprising Medicine,
speaks very largely in Commendation thereof, in a little Treatise of
his, written first in _French_, upon the same Subject; wherein he
boasts of a remarkable Cure perform'd by himself, in a most wonderful
manner, with only the use of this astonishing Powder; and, therefore,
as in religious Cases, Example goes beyond Precept, so, to convince you
of the Miracles perform'd by Sympathy, Instances, perhaps, may prove
more effectual than Arguments; for which Reason, I shall proceed to
furnish you with a notable Experiment of this Magical Powder, and so
conclude.

    "MR. _James Howel_, a trusty Servant to King _James_ the
    First, famous in those Days for Compiling a Treatise, entitled
    _Dendrologia_, and afterwards for his Legacy to the World, call'd,
    _EpistoliÃ¦ Ho-ElianÃ¦_, happen'd, when he was a Young Gentleman, to
    accidently come by, when two of his dearest Friends were fiercely
    Engag'd in a very dangerous Duel, and to prevent the Mischief very
    likely to ensue, too rashly catch'd hold, with his naked Hand, of
    his Sword, whose Passion prompted him to be the most desperate; in
    which attempt, the Weapon, being drawn through Mr. _Howel_'s Palm,
    cut the Nerves and Muscles thereof to the very Bone, and, as they
    were thus Scuffling, holding up the same Hand to defend one of his
    Friends from a Blow upon his Head, receiv'd another cut upon the
    back of his Hand, cross all the Veins and Tendons, more terrible
    than the former, which, his Friends perceiving, put a sudden stop
    to their inebrious Fury, run both to embrace him and to express
    their sorrow for the unhappy Accident, lending him their Assistance
    to bind up his Wounds with one of his own Garters, and so conducted
    him to his Lodgings, where they sent immediately for a Surgeon, who
    found the Case desperate, for he bled abundantly.

    "MR. _Howel_, being a Gentleman much respected by the Quality, the
    News of his Misfortune soon reach'd the Court; and his Majesty,
    having, also, a great regard for him, sent one of his own Surgeons
    to attend him, who found the Case to be so very bad that he seem'd
    doubtful of a Cure, without cutting off his Hand, which occasion'd
    Mr. _Howel_, about five Days after the Hurt receiv'd, to apply
    himself to his good Friend and Neighbour, Sir _Kenelm Digby_,
    who, at that Time was famous for the Sympathetick-Powder, begging
    his Assistance in that painful Extremity, telling him, that his
    Surgeons were apprehensive of a Gangrene.

    "SIR _Kenelm_, opening the Wounds, found a terrible Case of it,
    and a dangerous Inflamation upon the Part, which, Mr. _Howel_
    acknowledg'd, gave him such intolerable Pain as was scarce
    supportable; the Knight, ask'd him, if he had any Bandage with the
    Blood upon it, Mr. _Howel_ answer'd, _Yes_; accordingly sent his
    Servant for the bloody Garter which had first bound up his Wounds,
    and deliver'd it to Sir _Kenelm_, who, calling for a Bason of
    Water, went into his Closet for a handful of his Powder, which he
    infus'd therein, and then soak'd the Garter in the same Liquor;
    whilst Mr. _Howel_ was talking with another Gentleman, at the
    further End of the Room, not knowing in the least what Sir _Kenelm_
    was doing, who, after he had bath'd the Garter in the Bason about a
    Minute, call'd to his Patient and ask'd him how he found himself,
    who answer'd, _So wonderful Easy that the Inflamation seems to be
    totally Extinguish'd, the Pain quite gone off, and my Hand I find
    as cool and as much refresh'd, as if it was wrap'd up in a wet
    Napkin_. _Then_, reply'd the Knight, _fling off your Dressings,
    meddle no more with Plasters, only keep your Wounds clean and
    from the Air, and I doubt not, but in a few Days Time, I shall
    effectually Cure you, without putting you to any further Trouble_.
    Much Comforted with this Assurance, Mr. _Howel_ took a thankful
    Leave of Sir _Kenelm_, and so departed.

    "MR. _Howel_, had not been gone above a Quarter of an Hour, but
    the Knight took the Garter out of the Liquor, to dry it before the
    Fire, and carelesly hanging it a little too near, the extraordinary
    Heat, by the Concatination of Effluvia's, had such an Effect upon
    the Patient, that he made as many wry Faces as a Cook that had
    burnt his Fingers; dispatching his Servant, with all imaginable
    Expedition, to let his Doctor know what a Condition he was relaps'd
    into.

    "SIR _Kenelm_, who presently conjectur'd the Cause of this
    Disaster, smiling at the Message the Servant had deliver'd, and
    snatching the Garter from the Fire, told him, that his Master
    should be very Easy by the Time he could return to him, which
    the Footman, by the acknowledgment of his Master, found to be
    true accordingly; Sir _Kenelm_, doing nothing more to work this
    change, than cooling the wreaking Garter by a speedy Repetition
    of his former Application; so that, without any further Accident
    interposing, the Patient was thoroughly cur'd, in five or six Days
    Time, by this extraordinary Method, to the inexpressible Admiration
    of all his Majesty's Surgeons."

  _SIR_,

This is all, at present, I am at Leisure to say in Answer to your
Letter, and I doubt you will think it enough too, except more to
the purpose: What extraordinary Cures you happen to perform by your
new Method, I desire you will communicate to me as soon as you
can conveniently, for to hear of your Success, will be no little
Satisfaction to,

  _Sir_,
  _Your assured Friend
  and humble Servant_.


_FINIS._

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
